# README

Originally this repo was home to the notes produced for a short course I ran for PhD and post-doctoral researchers at Cranfield University in 2013.
The course starts at the **very** basics of R from what it actually looks like on your screen, to making your first graph and running your first t-test.

The course can be found here: <http://ivyleavedtoadflax.github.io/R_notes/>.

In time I intend to expand on the material here with code that is relevant to the job of being a Data Scientist in goverment, and this is where I see this course having relevance.
If you want a comprehensive course on R I would suggest: <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/> and <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/>.

The course was written in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
